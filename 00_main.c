/*

    To run a C program, we need an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

    IDE is a software or a platform that allows to edit, compile, execute and debug the program.

    Examples:
            Dev C++
            Visual Studio
            Code::Blocks
            Turbo C/C++     and so on.


    
    I prefer Visual Studio Code (VSC) to do all kind of coding.
    Dev C++ is a good IDE for C, C# and C++.


    USing C in Dev C++
    ~   Download the Dev-C++ installer
    ~   Install it. Don't forget to include gcc while installing.
    ~   Start by creating a new file in Dev C++.

            Press F11 to 'Compile and Run'.

    
    Using C in VSCode
    ~   In case of VSC, you need to install a compiler like 'MinGW'.

        Use youtube for help.

    C file extension is .c
    C++ is .c++ or .cpp
